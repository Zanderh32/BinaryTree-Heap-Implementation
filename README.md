# Binary Tree and Heap Implementation

This project contains Java implementations of two fundamental data structures: **Binary Trees** and **Heaps**. The repository includes code for inserting, deleting, and traversing elements in a binary tree and heap, along with corresponding test drivers to demonstrate their functionality.

## Features

- **Binary Tree Operations**:
  - Insert nodes into a binary tree.
  - Support for tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
  - Search for and delete nodes from the tree.

- **Heap Operations**:
  - Support for min-heap or max-heap (specify the type used).
  - Insert elements while maintaining heap properties.
  - Remove elements and re-balance the heap.

## Project Structure

### Files Included:

1. **HeapMain.java**
   - Implements heap data structure (min/max heap) operations such as insertion, deletion, and re-balancing.
   
2. **TreeDriver.java**
   - Driver class to test and demonstrate binary tree operations, such as node insertion, deletion, and various traversals.
   
3. **TreeNode.java**
   - Represents a node in the binary tree, containing data and references to the left and right children

**Requirements**
 - Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
